# 🚀 Go Mini Projects Journey

This repository contains my learning journey in **Golang**, starting from fundamentals to backend development, and eventually moving toward **Web3 development using Go**.

I am building these projects step-by-step to strengthen my understanding of:

* Core Go fundamentals
* HTTP & REST API development
* JSON handling
* Concurrency
* Database integration
* Clean Architecture
* Automation systems
* Web3 backend development
